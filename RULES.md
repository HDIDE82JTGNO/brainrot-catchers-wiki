Ensure all code follows professional software development practices:

Use proper OOP structure with metatables and self where appropriate.

Apply type annotations (Luau types for Roblox) for all function parameters and return values.

Follow clean code principles: clear naming, single-responsibility functions, modularity, and readability.

Avoid redundancy, commented-out legacy code, unnecessary globals, and never use _G.

Write code that is maintainable, scalable, and testable, with clear comments and documentation for complex logic.

Maintain consistent event-driven architecture where applicable.

Optimize for performance without sacrificing clarity or correctness.

If implementing features from old code, adapt them into the new modular design, never copy raw legacy code.

Never use hacky workarounds, it is bad practice.
